#This page tells how to install sase on your machine.

Since we developed SASE using Java, so a Java Runtime Environment is a pre-requisite. The engine also uses other libraries which are included in the SASE 1.0 package. We have tested the SASE system on UNIX, Mac OS X and Windows.

=Structure of the SASE 1.0 Package=
The structure of the SASE 1.0 package is as following.

 

|| *COPYRIGHT*  || lists the license under which this package has been released.||
|| *INSTALL*        || is a quick installation guide.||
|| *bin/* || contains the complied classes. ||
|| *build/*|| contains the JAR file
|| *doc/* || contains the Java doc.||
||*lib/* || contains the required libraries.||
|| *query/*|| contains the sample query files.||
||*scripts/*|| contains the sample script files.||
||*src/*|| contains the Java source files||


 
= Software Requirement =

 * Install the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Java Runtime Environment] version 1.5.x or later




= Configuration =

  * Download the [link SASE1.0] package and extract it to a suitable directory.
  * Set the SASE_HOME environment variable to point to the SASE installation directory.
  * Add $SASE_HOME/bin to the PATH to access all the executables.
  * Add $SASE_HOME/lib/jeval.jar to the CLASSPATH.
