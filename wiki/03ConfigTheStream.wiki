#This page tells you how to configurate the stream.

=Simulated stock stream=
In SASE1.0, if you want to use the default simulated stock stream, you can use a stream file to configurate the stream. There are several parameters you can change:

|| *streamSize*|| specifies the number of events in the input stream ||
|| *maxPrice*|| specifies the maximum value for the attribute "Price"||
|| *maxSymbol*|| specifies the maximum value for the attribute "Symbol"||
|| *maxVolume*|| specifies the maximum value for the attribute "Volume"||
|| *randomSeed*|| the seed for random number generator||
|| *increaseProbability*|| specifies the probability that the price increases||
|| *end*|| specifies the end of the input file||

The stream can also be configured by an input file describing the stream specs.
==Example==
{{{
 streamSize = 100000
 maxPrice = 1000
 maxSymbol = 2
 maxVolume = 1000
 randomSeed = 10
 increaseProbability = 70
 end
}}}

You can find more examples in the SASE 1.0 package under query/ folder. All query files use the extension *.stream*.

=Customized stream=
If you want to use your own customized stream, you need to follow these steps.
  # Implement the interface *edu.umass.cs.sase.stream.Event*
  # In class *edu.umass.cs.sase.stream.StreamController*, add a method to import  or generate your stream, wrapping each event using your own Event class implemented in Step1. *edu.umass.cs.sase.stream.StreamController.generateStockEventsAsConfig()* is a sample method.
