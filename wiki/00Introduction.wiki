=Introduction of SASE Release=
In this release, we include the stream processing engine of the SASE system developed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This stream engine provides fast matching of stream events against complex queries. 

The release of SASE 1.0 only contains the stream processing engine of the SASE system. More advanced features such as processing streams with imprecise timestamps are not included in this release.

==Major Components==
In the package of SASE 1.0, we include the following items:

  * Command Line User Interface
  * Stream Generator: generates synthetic data for academic experiments
  * NFA Parser: reads in NFA files in a predefined format
  * Query Evaluation Engine: evaluates streams against given queries


=Project Background=
Today high-volume event streams naturally exist in a variety of environments including sensing devices, financial services, network monitors, etc. An increasing number of applications require that useful information be extracted from such event streams in a timely manner. Such translation from event streams to useful, actionable information is realized by a new processing paradigm called complex event processing.

CEP aims to provide a set of core functions:

  * Filtering removes unwanted events
  * Correlation detects complex patterns across different events.
  * Aggregation computes aggregate values.
  * Transformation generates new types of events.
To this end, we are designing and implementing a complex event processor, which we call SASE (Stream-based And Shared Event processing). SASE provides:

  * A rich declarative event language
  * Formal semantics of the event language
  * Theorectical underpinnings of CEP
  * An efficient automata-based implementation
