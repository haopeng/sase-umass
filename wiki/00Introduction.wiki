=Introduction of SASE1.0=
SASE1.0 is a stream processing system, aka a CEP system. It supports complex query patterns and different selection strategies. The performance can achieve a high throughput.

=History=
SASE is an academic system for research on stream processing. It was used for our experiments in our [http://code.google.com/p/sase-umass/wiki/08Publications publications]. 

For this code release, the SASE system is totally rewritten. Comparing to the system we used for our previous publications, this SASE1.0 has a clearer architecture and an optimized engine. We removed some features mentioned in our publications, which may be added in future updates.

==Major Components==
In the package of Sase1.0, we include the following items:

  * Command Line User Interface
  * Stream Generator: generates synthetic data for academic experiments
  * NFA Parser: reads in NFA files in a predefined format
  * Query Evaluation Engine: evaluates streams against given queries


=Project Background=
Today high-volume event streams naturally exist in a variety of environments including sensing devices, financial services, network monitors, etc. An increasing number of applications require that useful information be extracted from such event streams in a timely manner. Such translation from event streams to useful, actionable information is realized by a new processing paradigm called complex event processing.

CEP aims to provide a set of core functions:

  * Filtering removes unwanted events
  * Correlation detects complex patterns across different events.
  * Aggregation computes aggregate values.
  * Transformation generates new types of events.
To this end, we are designing and implementing a complex event processor, which we call SASE (Stream-based And Shared Event processing). SASE provides:

  * A rich declarative event language
  * Formal semantics of the event language
  * Theorectical underpinnings of CEP
  * An efficient automata-based implementation
