#This page explains how to configure the stream generator.  

=Simulated stock stream=
In SASE1.0, if you want to use the default simulated stock stream, you can use a stream file to configure the stream generator. There are several parameters you can modify:

|| *streamSize*|| specifies the number of events in the input stream ||
|| *maxPrice*|| specifies the maximum value for the attribute "Price", the value of "Price" would be uniformly distributed on integers between 1 (inclusive) and the specific value (inclusive).||
|| *numOfSymbol*|| specifies the number of possible values for the attribute "Symbol", the value of "Symbol" would be uniformly distributed on integers between 1 (inclusive) and the specific value (inclusive)||
|| *maxVolume*|| specifies the maximum value for the attribute "Volume", the value of "Volume" would be uniformly distributed on integers between 1 (inclusive) and the specific value (inclusive)||
|| *randomSeed*|| the seed for random number generator||
|| *increaseProbability*|| specifies the probability that the price increases (%), the probabilities that the price stays the same and decreases are both (100 - probability)/2; for example, if the probability is set to 100, the price will strictly increase; if the probability is set to 60, the probability that the price will increase is 60%, the probability that the price will decrease is 20%, and the probability that the price will stay the same is also 20%.||


==Example==
{{{
 streamSize = 100000
 maxPrice = 1000
 numOfSymbol = 2
 maxVolume = 1000
 randomSeed = 10
 increaseProbability = 70
 end
}}}

You can find more examples in the SASE 1.0 package under the *examples* folder and the *tests* folder. All query files use the extension *.stream*.

=Customized stream=
If you want to use your own customized stream, you need to follow these steps.
  # Implement the interface *edu.umass.cs.sase.stream.Event*
  # In class *edu.umass.cs.sase.stream.StreamController*, add a method to import  or generate your stream, wrapping each event using your own Event class implemented in Step1. *edu.umass.cs.sase.stream.StreamController.generateStockEventsAsConfig()* is a sample method.
