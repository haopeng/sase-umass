=SASE 1.0 Release=
We are delighted to release the first version of SASE - SASE 1.0.

SASE is a stream processing system developed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. SASE provides fast pattern matching over streams. It supports complex pattern queries and achieves high throughput. The release of SASE 1.0 contains the stream processing engine of the SASE system. Some advanced features such as processing streams with imprecise timestamps are not included in this release.

In the package of SASE 1.0, we include the following components:

  * *Query Evaluation Engine*: evaluates pattern queries over streams
  * *NFA Parser*: reads in an automaton-based representation of a query in a pre-defined format
  * *Stream Generator*: generates synthetic data for experiments
  * *Command Line User Interface*

SASE 1.0 is implemented in the Java language, using J2SE 5.0. We have tested SASE 1.0 on Windows, Mac and Unix.
