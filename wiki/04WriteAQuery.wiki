#labels query
#This page tells you how to write a query.

The SASE 1.0 uses a query file to describe a query. A query file consists of two parts: header information and states.

=Header=
In header information part, we have several parameters:
||selectionStrategy|| specifies the selection strategy for the query, in SASE 1.0, you can choose "skip-till-ext-match" or "partition-contiguity"||
||timeWindow || specifies the size of time window||
||partition attribute || optional, you can specify an attribute as the partition attribute||
==


= Sample =

selectionStrategy = skip-till-next-match | timeWindow = 10000  | partitionAttribute = price

State=1 & type = normal & eventtype = stock1 | edgetype = begin 

State=2 & type = normal & eventtype = stock2 | edgetype = begin 

State=3 & type = normal & eventtype = stock3 | edgetype = begin 

end


= Format Explanation =

The first line is the config line, describing the selection strategy, the time window and the partiton attribute if any.

The following lines except the last represent states, and each line corresponds to one state.

You can find more examples in SASE 1.0 package under query/ folder. All query files use extension *.query*.
