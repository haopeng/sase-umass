#This page explains how to write a query in a predefined format.

SASE 1.0 supports two formats for representing a query:
  * Query input
  * NFA input
We will explain both formats as follows

=1. Query Input=
The query inputs uses a more friendly style, which is similar to the language we used in our SIGMOD 08 paper. Look at the following example:

{{{
PATTERN SEQ(stock+ a, stock b)
WHERE partition-contiguity
AND [symbol]
AND a[1].price % 500 == 0
AND a[i].price > min(a[..i-1].price)
AND b.volume < 150
WITHIN 500
}}}
==1.1 Keywords==
|| PATTERN || Designates the pattern ||
|| SEQ(component, component,...) || Specifies the components of the pattern.A normal component is in the format "eventType alias", a Kleene closure component is in the format "eventType+ alias", a negation component is in the format "!eventType alias". The aliases should follow the alphabetical order, e.g, the first component uses 'a', the second component uses 'b', etc. A ',' is used between components.||
|| WHERE || Designate the conditions ||
|| AND || Connects two conditions ||
|| WITHIN || Specifies the time window ||

==1.2 Examples==
=2. NFA Input= 

SASE 1.0 uses a query file to describe a query. A query file consists of two parts: header information and states.

If you want to know more details about the keywords to appear below, please read our [http://sase-umass.googlecode.com/files/sase-sigmod08.pdf SIGMOD 08 paper], which will help you to understand the queries.

==2.1 Header==
In header information part, we have several parameters:
||selectionStrategy|| specifies the selection strategy for the query, in SASE 1.0, you can choose "skip-till-next-match" or "partition-contiguity"||
||timeWindow || specifies the size of time window||
||partition attribute || optional, you can specify an attribute as the partition attribute||

==2.2 States==
Each query is represented by a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA).  In the second part of the query file, we describe the states of the NFA. For each NFA state, we use one line to describe it. In each line, we have multiple parameters as following:

||State|| assigns a number to this state||
||type|| specifies the type of this state, "normal" or "kleeneClosure"||
||eventtype|| specifies the event type which satisfies this state||

We use an "&" symbol to connect the parameters.

After providing the basic information for this state,  we can describe the edge(s), and each edge can be separated by "|". An edge contains the edgetype and predicate(s).

||edgetype|| specifies the type of an edge, "begin" , "take" or "proceed"||
||predicate|| specifies the requirement for this state. If you want to use an equation, please use "==" instead of "=", e.g., "price == 10".||

==2.3 Example ==
{{{
SelectionStrategy = partition-contiguity | TimeWindow = 500 | partitionAttribute = symbol
State=1 & type = kleeneClosure & eventtype = stock | edgetype = begin  & price % 500 == 0 | edgetype = take | edgetype = proceed 
State=2 & type = normal & eventtype = stock | edgetype = begin & volume < 150
end
}}}


You can find more examples in SASE 1.0 package under the *examples* folder and the *tests* folder. All query files use the extension *.query*.
