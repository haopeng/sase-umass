#labels query
#This page tells you how to write a query.

The SASE 1.0 uses a query file to describe a query. A query file consists of two parts: header information and states.

=Header=
In header information part, we have several parameters:
||selectionStrategy|| specifies the selection strategy for the query, in SASE 1.0, you can choose "skip-till-ext-match" or "partition-contiguity"||
||timeWindow || specifies the size of time window||
||partition attribute || optional, you can specify an attribute as the partition attribute||
==


= Sample =
{{{
selectionStrategy = skip-till-next-match | timeWindow = 10000  | partitionAttribute = price
State=1 & type = normal & eventtype = stock1 | edgetype = begin 
State=2 & type = normal & eventtype = stock2 | edgetype = begin 
State=3 & type = normal & eventtype = stock3 | edgetype = begin 
end
}}}



You can find more examples in SASE 1.0 package under query/ folder. All query files use extension *.query*.
