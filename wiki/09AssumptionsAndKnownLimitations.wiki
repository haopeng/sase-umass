#This page summarizes the assumptions and known limitations of the code comparing to related research.

= Assumptions =
We have the following assumptions:
  * *Time-based window*: the windows is time-based instead of count-based
  * *Total order*: we assume  events of the input stream are in order of occurrence time.
 
=Known Limitations =
The SASE 1.0 has the following known limitations:
  * *Overlapping/non-overlapping*: In our SIGMOD2008 [http://sase-umass.googlecode.com/files/sase-sigmod08.pdf paper], we mentioned "overlapping/non-overlapping". In this release, we only support the "overlapping" mode.
  * *AND*: We do not support the "AND" operator, which allows arbitrary order among consecutive components. For example, for pattern {{{SEQ(A, (B AND C), D)}}}, both {{{SEQ(A, B, C, D)}}} and {{{SEQ(A, C, B, D)}}} will be allowed.
  * *OR*: We do not support the "OR" operator, which allows alternative events for a component. For example, for pattern {{{SEQ (A, (B OR C), D)}}}, both {{{SEQ(A, B, D)}}} and {{{SEQ(A, C, D)}}} will be allowed.
  * *Shared Versioned Match Buffer*: In the release we do not include this feature metioned in our SIGMOD 2008 [http://sase-umass.googlecode.com/files/sase-sigmod08.pdf paper].
  * *Imprecise timestamps*: Support for imprecise timestamps, introduced by our VLDB2010 [http://sase-umass.googlecode.com/files/sase-vldb10.pdf  paper] is not included in this release.
