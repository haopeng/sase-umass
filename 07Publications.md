> <font size='2'><i>Abstract</i>:Large-scale event systems are becoming increasingly popular in  a variety of domains. Event pattern evaluation plays a key role in  monitoring applications in these domains. Existing work on pattern evaluation, however, assumes that the occurrence time of each event is known precisely and the events from various sources can be merged into a single stream with a total or partial order. We observe that in real-world applications event occurrence times are often unknown or imprecise. Therefore, we propose a temporal model that assigns a time interval to each event to represent all of its possible occurrence times and revisit pattern evaluation under this model. In particular, we propose the formal semantics of such pattern evaluation, two evaluation frameworks, and algorithms and optimizations in these frameworks. Our evaluation results using both real traces and synthetic systems show that the event-based framework always outperforms the point-based framework and with optimizations, it achieves high efficiency for a wide range of workloads tested. </font>

> <font size='2'><i>Abstract</i>:Pattern matching over event streams is increasingly being employed in many areas including nancial services, RFID-based inventory management, click stream analysis, and electronic health systems. While regular expression matching is well studied, pattern matching over streams presents two new challenges: Languages for pattern matching over streams are signicantly richer than languages for regular expression matching. Furthermore, ecient evaluation of these pattern queries over streams requires new algorithms and optimizations: the conventional wisdom for stream query processing i.e., using selection-join-aggregation) is inadequate.<br>
<blockquote>In this paper, we present a formal evaluation model that offers precise semantics for this new class of queries and a query evaluation framework permitting optimizations in a principled way. We further analyze the runtime complexity of query evaluation using this model and develop a suite of techniques that improve runtime eciency by exploiting sharing in storage and processing. Our experimental results provide insights into the various factors on runtime performance and demonstrate the signicant performance gains of our sharing techniques.</font></blockquote>

> <font size='2'><i>Abstract</i>:In this paper, we present SASE+, a complex event language that supports Kleene closure over event streams, and provide a formal analysis of the expressibility of this language. Complex event patterns involving Kleene closure are finding application in a growing number of stream applications including financial services, RFID-based inventory management, monitoring in healthcare, etc. While Kleene closure has been well studied for regular expression matching, Kleene closure patterns over streams have unique features regarding the event definition, event selection, and termination criteria, which fundamentally distinguish them from patterns studied in conventional problems. This paper addresses Kleene closure in this new context. In particular, we propose a compact language that can be used to define a wide variety of Kleene closure patterns, develop a formal model that precisely describes the semantics and expressive power of the language, and characterize its relationships to standard languages in the literature as well as recent proposals for stream-based event languages.</font>

> <font size='2'><i>Abstract</i>:RFID technology is gaining adoption on an increasing scale for tracking and monitoring purposes. Wide deployments of RFID devices will soon generate an unprecedented volume of data. Emerging applications require the RFID data to be filtered and correlated for complex pattern detection and transformed to events that provide meaningful, actionable information to end applications. In this work, we design and develop SASE, a complex event processing system that performs such datainformation transformations over real-time streams. We design a complex event language for specifying application logic for such transformation, devise new query processing techniques to efficiently implement the language, and develop a comprehensive system that collects, cleans, and processes RFID data for delivery of relevant, timely information as well as storing necessary data for future querying. We demonstrate an initial prototype of SASE through a real-world retail management scenario. </font>

> <font size='2'><i>Abstract</i>: In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evalua-tion of a system that executes complex event  queries over real-time streams of RFID readings encoded as events. These complex event queries filter and correlate events to match specific patterns, and transform the relevant events into new composite events for the use of external monitoring applications. Stream-based execution of these queries enables time-critical actions to be taken in environments such as supply chain management, surveillance and facility management, healthcare, etc. We first propose a complex event language that significantly extends existing event languages to meet the needs of a range of RFID-enabled monitoring applica-tions. We then describe a query plan-based approach to efficiently implementing this language. Our approach uses native operators to efficiently handle query-defined sequences, which are a key com-ponent of complex event processing, and pipelines such sequences to subsequent operators that are built by leveraging relational tech-niques. We also develop a large suite of optimization techniques to address challenges such as large sliding windows and intermediate result sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a detailed performance analysis of our prototype implementation as well as through a comparison to a state-of-the-art stream processor. </font>
